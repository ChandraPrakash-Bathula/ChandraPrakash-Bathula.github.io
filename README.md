# 👋 Hi, I’m Chandra Prakash Bathula

🚀 Machine Learning Practitioner | CV/NLP-LLM Researcher | Web Developer | Storyteller

I'm on a mission to make machine learning accessible, interpretable, and impactful — from healthcare and education to fraud detection and beyond.

🛠️ Projects I’m building:
- 🔍 **End-to-End Interpretable ML Pipelines** using LLMs (GPT-4/BioGPT + SHAP + Counterfactuals)
- 🧠 **108 Blog Series on Deep Learning** — real-world examples, clean code, and deep clarity
- 📘 Writing a **Beginner’s Book on ML/DL**
- 🌐 Open-source **ML Experimentation UI** (featurization → visualization → training → evaluation)

🧩 Interests: Interpretability, NLP, Topology-Aware Embedding, Ensemble Models, Contrastive Learning
